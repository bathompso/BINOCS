=========

binaryfit is a suite of python codes that facilitate binary star detection in open clusters. A paper detailing the inner workings of the main binaryfit routine, as well as initial results for several open clusters is in prep.

Dependencies
------------

Running the included python programs will require Python 2.7 or above, as well as numpy.

The binaryfit python routines are parallelized in order to run in a reasonable amount of time. Before running any of these routines, please make sure to install the python modules [ParallelPython](http://parallelpython.com) and [PyOpenCL](http://mathema.tician.de/software/pyopencl/)
